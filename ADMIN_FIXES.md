# 🔧 Admin Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. 🔄 **Admin Logout on Page Refresh**

**Problem**: Admin users were being logged out when refreshing the page because admin state restoration was dependent on restaurants loading first.

**Solution**:

-   Added separate `useEffect` that immediately restores admin user and token on mount
-   Made restaurant loading independent of admin state restoration
-   Added proper token management for admin authentication

```typescript
// Added immediate admin state restoration
useEffect(() => {
    const savedAdmin = localStorage.getItem("adminUser");
    const savedToken = localStorage.getItem("adminToken");

    if (savedAdmin && savedToken) {
        const admin = JSON.parse(savedAdmin);
        setAdminUser(admin);
        setToken(savedToken);
    }
}, []); // Run once on mount
```

### 2. 📊 **Restaurants Not Showing for Platform Admin**

**Problem**: Platform admin couldn't see restaurants because:

-   Token retrieval was only looking for `adminToken`
-   No automatic refresh of restaurants when admin state was restored
-   Missing loading states and error handling

**Solution**:

-   Updated token retrieval to check both `adminToken` and regular `token`
-   Added automatic restaurant refresh when admin user is loaded
-   Added loading states and better error handling
-   Added console logging for debugging

```typescript
// Improved token retrieval
const getAuthToken = () => {
    return localStorage.getItem("adminToken") || localStorage.getItem("token");
};

// Auto-refresh restaurants when admin loads
useEffect(() => {
    if (adminUser && token) {
        refreshRestaurants();
    }
}, [adminUser, token, refreshRestaurants]);
```

### 3. 🛠 **Additional Improvements**

-   Added loading states to prevent race conditions
-   Enhanced error handling with console logging
-   Improved admin context type definitions
-   Better separation of concerns between auth and data fetching

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Login as Platform Admin**:

    - Go to admin panel
    - Login with `admin@platform.com` / `admin123`
    - Should see restaurants list

2. **Test Page Refresh**:

    - While logged in as admin, refresh the page
    - Should remain logged in and see restaurants

3. **Test Restaurant Admin**:
    - Login as restaurant admin (e.g., `admin@pizzapalace.com` / `pizza123`)
    - Should see their restaurant data
    - Refresh page - should stay logged in

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

✅ Admin users stay logged in after page refresh  
✅ Platform admin can see all restaurants  
✅ Restaurant admin can see their restaurant  
✅ Proper loading states during data fetch  
✅ Error handling for failed requests

The admin panel should now work reliably with persistent authentication! 🚀
